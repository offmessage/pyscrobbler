===============
PyScrobbler 1.0
===============

General information
-------------------

This version of pyscrobbler is designed to use the 1.0 query protocol and the
1.1 submission protocol.  Both of these protocols have been superceded (version
2.0 and 1.2.1, respectively).  This version will continue to be maintained
until a new version has been written to support the new APIs.

Installation requirements
-------------------------

This code will work with any Python 2.x from 2.3 and up.  I've not even begun
to think about Python 3.  It might work with earlier python versions, but I'm
unable to test.

If you are using python 2.3 or 2.4 you will need to install the elementtree
package separately in order for this code to work.

The project has moved and is now hosted at 
http://github.com/offmessage/pyscrobbler

Additional maintainers are always welcome.
